This is the repo for the UCLA Radio website.

We're using Ruby on Rails to build the site, and the Publify blogging platform.
You can find more info in the PUBLIFY_README.md file.

This is currently setup to use SQLite. Included in the config/ folder are
database.yml.mysql and database.yml.postgresql files.

To use My / PGSQL, change the current database.yml file to database.yml.sqlite,
and then rename the desired one to database.yml.

You can also read all of this in PUBLIFY_README.md. Lol
